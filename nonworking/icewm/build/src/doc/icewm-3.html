<P>The IceWM suite consists of the following core applications provided by
the main package:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>icewm - the actual window manager binary. This is the one you need to
get window decorations.</LI>
<LI>icewmbg - the background setting applications. It can assign plain
background color or images in different formats to the X background,
shared or separated for different workspaces. This program should be
started before IceWM startup.</LI>
<LI>icewmtray - catches the Docklet objects installed by various
applications like PSI</LI>
<LI>icewm-session - runs all of the above when needed</LI>
<LI>icewm-menu-gnome1 - used internaly, generates IceWM program menus from
located GNOME(1) menus</LI>
<LI>icewm-menu-gnome2 - used internaly, generates IceWM program menus from
FreeDesktop .desktop files (KDE/GNOME(2) menus).</LI>
<LI>icewmhint - used internaly</LI>
</UL>
</P>

</H2>


<P>The <CODE>icewm</CODE> executable must be in your path for the restart
function to work correctly.  Please set your $PATH environment
variable accordingly. The <CODE>icewm</CODE> program alone is suitable for usabe
with Desktop environments like GNOME.</P>
<P>If you wish to run the whole IceWM suite (WM, background changer,
Docklet support, and startup/shutdown script handling), use the
<CODE>icewm-session</CODE> binary instead of pure <CODE>icewm</CODE>. Note that this is
not a complete Session Manager but a helps only to automate the startup.</P>
<P>First make sure that you choose the correct X startup script in your
home directory. For most distributions the file $HOME/.xsession is
honored by startx and X Display Managers like kdm. On RedHat, the
$HOME/.Xclients may be used instead. In all cases, choose the one
recommended by your distribution and make sure that there
is no concurency between the X startup scripts.</P>
<P>The recommended way to start is from $HOME/.xsession shell script (may
be executable, must be on RedHat). Mine looks something like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
# run profile to set $PATH and other env vars correctly
. $HOME/.bash_profile
# setup touchpad and the external mouse
xset m 7 2
xinput set-ptr-feedback 0 7 1.9 1

# start icewm-session
exec icewm-session
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The xterm on the last line is there simply to make sure that your X
session doesn't crash if icewm does (should never happen). You can
restart icewm from there or start some other window manager. The
session will close if you close the xterm.</P>
<P>The above should work for most Linux systems. On commercial unices you
should use $HOME/.dtprofile if you have CDE or $HOME/.vueprofile for
HP-UX with HP VUE. If you are running xdm or some other login program
check it's manpage for the correct place to start the window manager
(usually &nbsp;/.xsession or &nbsp;/.Xsession, sometimes also &nbsp;/.xinitrc.os5).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="icewm.html#toc3.3">Startup and shutdown scripts</A>
</H2>


<P>After initialization IceWM-Session will search the resource path (
<A HREF="icewm-7.html#lib">lib</A>
)
for a startup script. If this file is found to exist and to be executeable
IceWM-Session will run the script. On startup IceWM-Session will search for a script
called "startup". And during the termination of icewm, the
"shutdown" script is executed.</P>
<P>Additionally the flag "--with-gnome" is passed if a GNOME session 
manager is detected.</P>
<P>Example (startup):
<PRE>
#!/bin/bash

[ -x ~/.icewm/restart ] &amp;&amp; source ~/.icewm/restart

gnome-terminal --geometry 80x25+217+235 &amp;
xscreensaver &amp;
</PRE>
</P>
<P><B>Hint: </B> 
This feature is meant for easy desktop initialization and it is
part of IceWM due popular demand. For more sophisticated session management 
you should learn how to use a real session manager - IceWM does support 
the XSESSION protocol.</P>
